# React-Redux Pizza Configurator
This project was build as week 5 homework of the Codaisseur academy.

## This project included the following requirements:

Create a pizza configurator for NewAgePizza.com, a new and hip venture to get your pizza.
It should be a single page where the user can first choose a base, then a sauce, and finally some 3 toppings.
Last but not least, the user can choose turbo-drone-delivery which is an additional 10% on top of the total pizza price.

It is important that the user can change previous steps even if they already changed stuff before.
So they could pick a base, a sauce and a topping and switch the base after that.

### Additional instructions:

   If any base is picked there should always be a price shown for the total pizza.
   The Redux store should contain the state of the pizza

This project was bootstraped with `Create-React-App` and uses `Redux` for state management.

## To run:
- clone/download the repo
- `yarn install` to add the dependencies
- `yarn start` to start the app
